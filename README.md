# Forecasting of Carbon Dioxide Emission: Time Series Analysis

## Problem Statement 

Forecasting of carbon dioxide emission at Mauna Loa, Hawaii from monthly mean data using univariate time series analysis

## Data Collection

Variable - Monthly mean CO2 in parts per million collected at Mauna Loa, Hawaii

Start date - Jan 1990

End date - Jun 2020

Frequency - Monthly data

Observations - 366

Source - https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/gl_data.html

## Stepwise Analysis

1- Visualize the time series data

2- Collect the deseasonalized time series.

3- Perform the ADF test on the deseasonalized time series.

4- Check for the deterministic trend and get the stationary time series

5- Apply Ljung Box test to determine the model

6- Determine the correct model

7- Get the model equation

8- Perform Ljung Box test to check for white noise

9- Forecast the monthly mean carbon emission in ppm for the next five years

## Conclusion

From the above plot, it can be concluded that the carbon emission level will increase in the upcoming years, which is not a good sign for the earth.
